# Django Static and Media Files Setup Guide

In Django, **static files** (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) and **media files** (user-uploaded files) are handled separately. This guide will walk you through configuring and managing static and media files in your Django project.

## 1. Static Files

### What are Static Files?
Static files are assets like CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts that are used to style and enhance the functionality of your Django project.

### Configuring Static Files

1. **Add Static Settings to `settings.py`**:
   Open your `settings.py` file and configure the following settings:
   ```python
   import os

   STATIC_URL = '/static/'
   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')  # For production
   STATICFILES_DIRS = [
       os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),  # For development
   ]
   ```

   - `STATIC_URL`: The URL prefix for static files (e.g., `/static/`).
   - `STATIC_ROOT`: The directory where static files will be collected for production.
   - `STATICFILES_DIRS`: Additional directories where Django will look for static files during development.

2. **Create a Static Directory**:
   Create a `static` directory in your project's root folder:
   ```
   projectname/
   ├── static/
   │   ├── css/
   │   ├── js/
   │   └── images/
   ```

3. **Collect Static Files for Production**:
   When deploying your project, run the following command to collect all static files into the `STATIC_ROOT` directory:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

### Using Static Files in Templates

To use static files in your Django templates, load the `static` template tag and reference the file path:

```html
{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/styles.css' %}">
    <script src="{% static 'js/script.js' %}"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <img src="{% static 'images/logo.png' %}" alt="Logo">
</body>
</html>
```

## 2. Media Files

### What are Media Files?
Media files are user-uploaded files, such as profile pictures, documents, or other content generated by users.

### Configuring Media Files

1. **Add Media Settings to `settings.py`**:
   Open your `settings.py` file and configure the following settings:
   ```python
   import os

   MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
   MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
   ```

   - `MEDIA_URL`: The URL prefix for media files (e.g., `/media/`).
   - `MEDIA_ROOT`: The directory where uploaded files will be stored.

2. **Create a Media Directory**:
   Create a `media` directory in your project's root folder:
   ```
   projectname/
   ├── media/
   │   ├── uploads/
   ```

### Serving Media Files in Development

To serve media files during development, add the following to your project's `urls.py` file:

```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # Your other URL patterns
]

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

This ensures that media files are served when `DEBUG = True`.

## 3. Production Considerations

In production, you should **not** rely on Django to serve static or media files. Instead, configure your production server (e.g., using a cloud service or a dedicated web server) to handle these files.

### Disable Debug Mode
In production, ensure `DEBUG = False` in your `settings.py` file:
```python
DEBUG = False
```

## Summary

- **Static Files**: Used for CSS, JavaScript, and images. Configured using `STATIC_URL`, `STATIC_ROOT`, and `STATICFILES_DIRS`.
- **Media Files**: Used for user-uploaded content. Configured using `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT`.
- **Production**: Use a production-ready server to serve static and media files.
